# DSolver Simulator (repo context)

## What this service does
- DSolver Simulator is a fast simulation API for DeFi swaps and routing, built on Tycho state.
- Rust Axum service that consumes a Tycho broadcaster stream, keeps an in-memory pool state, and exposes HTTP endpoints for quote simulation and route encoding.
- Main local binaries: `dsolver-tycho-broadcaster-service` feeds the local stream, and `dsolver-simulator-service` exposes `/status`, `/ready`, `/simulate`, and `/encode`.

## Local run
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set `TYCHO_API_KEY` (required).
- Keep `TYCHO_BROADCASTER_URL` pointed at the broadcaster HTTP base URL and configure `BROADCASTER_REDIS_URL` plus `BROADCASTER_REDIS_STREAM_KEY` for Redis deltas. The local default lets the lifecycle helper start the broadcaster on port `3001` before the simulator.
- RFQ feeds default to off. For RFQ analysis, set `ENABLE_RFQ_POOLS=true` and read the selected chain's `rfq_protocols` in `simulator-manifest.toml` for the actual provider set.
- When `ENABLE_RFQ_POOLS=true` and the manifest lists `rfq_protocols`, the simulator requires every listed provider credential pair at startup and aborts if any are missing. `/encode` signs RFQ firm quotes with those credentials.
- Set `CHAIN_ID` (`1` for Ethereum, `8453` for Base) or pass `--chain-id` to the analyzer.
- Tycho health checks expect `Authorization: <TYCHO_API_KEY>` (no `Bearer` prefix).
- Start the local stack:
  ```bash
  scripts/start_server.sh --repo . --chain-id 1
  ```
- When `BROADCASTER_REDIS_URL` is loopback `redis://`, the lifecycle helper starts Redis from `docker-compose.redis.yml` before the local broadcaster. Use `scripts/verify_broadcaster_redis.sh --repo .` while services are running to confirm the broadcaster replay boundary, available Redis stream history, and simulator catch-up status.
- Default bind: `127.0.0.1:3000` (override with `HOST`/`PORT`).

## Readiness
- `GET /status` always returns HTTP `200` with current service and backend state.
- `GET /ready` returns HTTP `200` when native traffic can be served and `503` with the same state detail otherwise.
- `backends.native.status` carries native readiness; `backends.vm.status` and `backends.rfq.status` keep backend-specific readiness separate when those backends are configured.
- Cold starts can take several minutes (3–5+ mins; VM or RFQ pools can take up to roughly 10 minutes on a fresh warmup).
- `scripts/wait_ready.sh --expect-chain-id <id>` is still the manual guard if you want the native readiness gate directly.
- When VM pools matter, prefer `scripts/wait_ready.sh --url http://localhost:3000/ready --expect-chain-id <id> --require-vm-ready --timeout 600`.
- When RFQ pools matter, prefer `scripts/wait_ready.sh --url http://localhost:3000/ready --expect-chain-id <id> --require-rfq-ready --timeout 600`.
- When both VM and RFQ backends matter on Ethereum, prefer `scripts/wait_ready.sh --url http://localhost:3000/ready --expect-chain-id 1 --require-vm-ready --require-rfq-ready --timeout 600`.

## Local analysis workflow (recommended)
- Run the reporting-first analyzer:
  - `cargo run -p apps --bin sim-analysis -- --chain-id 1 --stop`
  - `cargo run -p apps --bin sim-analysis -- --chain-id 8453 --stop`
- The analyzer starts or reuses the local broadcaster plus simulator stack, waits for service health, confirms native readiness first, auto-checks VM and RFQ backends when they are enabled, runs representative `/simulate` probes and the balanced `/encode` route matrix, executes latency and light stress sweeps, then writes artifacts under `logs/simulation-reports/`.
- The `/encode` matrix uses live `/simulate` prep hops to assemble 3 SimpleSwap routes, 3 MultiSwap routes, and 2 MegaSwap routes per supported chain. Prep hops are reported separately as `encode-prep` scenarios.
- On Base with RFQ enabled and ready, the encode probes include a Bebop partial-fill diagnostic that checks router calldata for the packed `originalFilledTakerAmount` token-in invariant.
- Default output root:
  - `logs/simulation-reports/<chain-id>/balanced/<timestamp>/`
- Main artifacts:
  - `summary.md` for the narrative overview
  - `report.json` for exact metrics and scenario breakdowns
  - `evidence/` for sampled request/response bodies, readiness snapshots, and simulator/broadcaster log excerpts
- Redis replay fields from simulator `/status` subscriptions are preserved in `report.json` and summarized in `summary.md` when present.
- RFQ-enabled runs should also surface RFQ readiness, RFQ-visibility findings, and any Bebop encode-inspection findings in `summary.md` and `report.json`.
- Baseline comparison is meant to be flexible. Use the latest saved run when it helps, disable it with `--baseline none` when you want a clean one-off read.
- The analyzer does not act like a branch gate. It reports healthy, degraded, and errored behavior so a reviewer can investigate.

## Deployment context

- This skill owns local analysis, not AWS topology discovery.
- A captured request may come from any deployment whose resolved manifest proves a simulator dependency.
- Current production DSolver V2 performs its simulation work in-process. Do not turn that observed topology into a claim that V2 can never use this service.
- Use the global `solver-simulator-health` skill for deployed simulator health and its resolved dependency context.
