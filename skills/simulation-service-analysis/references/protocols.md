# Protocol feeds (what this server subscribes to)

The service subscribes to chain-specific Tycho exchanges at startup (see `src/config/mod.rs` and `src/services/stream_builder.rs`).

## Native feeds by chain

### Ethereum (`CHAIN_ID=1`)
- `uniswap_v2`
- `sushiswap_v2`
- `pancakeswap_v2`
- `uniswap_v3`
- `pancakeswap_v3`
- `uniswap_v4`
- `ekubo_v2`
- `fluid_v1`
- `rocketpool`
- `erc4626`
- `ekubo_v3`

### Base (`CHAIN_ID=8453`)
- `uniswap_v2`
- `uniswap_v3`
- `uniswap_v4`
- `pancakeswap_v3`
- `aerodrome_slipstreams`

## VM feeds by chain

### Ethereum (`CHAIN_ID=1`)
- `vm:curve`
- `vm:balancer_v2`
- `vm:maverick_v2`

### Base (`CHAIN_ID=8453`)
- No VM protocols configured in this iteration.

## RFQ feeds by chain

### Ethereum (`CHAIN_ID=1`)
- `rfq:bebop`
- `rfq:hashflow`

### Base (`CHAIN_ID=8453`)
- No RFQ protocols configured in this iteration.

## Effective VM enablement

- Runtime VM state is `effective_vm_enabled = ENABLE_VM_POOLS && vm_protocols_not_empty`.
- This means Base reports `vm_enabled=false` even if `ENABLE_VM_POOLS=true`.
- The local analyzer waits for VM readiness automatically on Ethereum when VM pools are enabled.

## Effective RFQ enablement

- Runtime RFQ state is `effective_rfq_enabled = ENABLE_RFQ_POOLS && rfq_protocols_not_empty`.
- This means Base reports `rfq_enabled=false` even if `ENABLE_RFQ_POOLS=true`.
- On Ethereum, enabling RFQ analysis also requires `BEBOP_USER`, `BEBOP_KEY`, `HASHFLOW_USER`, and `HASHFLOW_KEY`.
- The local analyzer waits for RFQ readiness automatically on Ethereum when RFQ pools are enabled.

## Notes that affect local analysis

- Always pass chain context to the analyzer (`--chain-id` or env `CHAIN_ID`).
- The analyzer uses representative pairs for native, stable, governance, VM-sensitive, and RFQ-targeted paths. Treat protocol visibility as evidence, not as a hard assertion that every protocol must surface on every run.
- Ethereum runs can take longer when VM or RFQ pools are enabled. If the analyzer waits on those backends, that is expected on cold starts.
- Base should keep Aerodrome visible somewhere in the balanced report, but absence is a finding to investigate rather than an automatic failure.
- Base should not be expected to show RFQ coverage today because it has no RFQ protocols configured.
- ERC4626 and other edge features are still highly state-sensitive. Use the analyzer report to decide whether you need deeper focused requests rather than baking every edge path into the default run.
- TVL filtering matters: pools are included or removed based on `TVL_THRESHOLD` and `TVL_KEEP_RATIO`.
  If a protocol disappears unexpectedly, lowering `TVL_THRESHOLD` may be worth testing in a follow-up run.
- Protocol labels in the analyzer are inferred from returned pool data and `meta.pool_results`. They are useful for comparison and triage, but they are still downstream observations of live state.
- RFQ-targeted simulate scenarios are meant to make RFQ visibility intentional on Ethereum. If they do not surface any `rfq:*` protocols, treat that as a finding to investigate rather than an automatic failure.
